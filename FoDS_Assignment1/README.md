## Assignment 1-A : Regression without regularization

- Build ```polynomial regression models``` (with degrees varying from 1 to 9) to predict
the target variable based on the input feature variable. Determine the degree of
the polynomial which best fits the given data

- Apply ```batch gradient descent``` to train the models

- Train each model for 500 iterations.

## Assignment 1-B Polynomial Regression and Regularization

- Develop nine polynomial regression models (with degrees varying from 1 to 9) to
predict the target variable based on the two input feature variables. Determine the
degree of the polynomial which best fits the given data.

- Build polynomial regression models of best fit degree (obtained from above) with the
following generalized regularized error function

- Build different regression models by taking ```q as 0.5,1,2,4```.

- Experiment with Î» values between 0 and 1 to obtain the optimal model for each
value of q.

- Use both ```Stochastic and Batch Gradient Descent```. Report best models for each of the
method.

- Plot ```Surface plots``` for the nine polynomial regression models and the four optimal
regularized linear regression models.
